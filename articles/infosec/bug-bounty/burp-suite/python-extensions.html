            <h1>How to install extensions </h1>

            <p>
                As you can se below, to use certain extensions from Burp suite you must install Jython - which you don't
                have to know what it is - but it is very simple to set up.
            </p>

            <img src="../../../../images/python-extensions/1.png" alt="">

            <p>Go to <a href="https://www.jython.org/download.html">https://www.jython.org/download.html</a> and make
                sure to click on the Standalone link</p>

            <img src="../../../../images/python-extensions/2.png" alt="">
            <p>
                (Check twice, i've already made the mistake to download the wrong version)
            </p>
            <img src="../../../../images/python-extensions/3.png" alt="">
            <p>
                Now go to Burp and in the main tab look for "Extensions" and then click in "Extensions settings". This will open a new wizard:
            </p>

            <p>
               This will open a new wizard: 
            </p>
            <img src="../../../../images/python-extensions/5.png" alt="">
            <p>
                Scroll down to "Python environment", hit "Select file" and locate your jython file 
            </p>
            <img src="../../../../images/python-extensions/6.png" alt="">
            <p>
                After selecting your file, click "Open" and if you can see the location of your file it's all done.

            </p>
            <p>ps: You can also move the extension to another directory other than Downloads so that you don't delete it accidentaly when cleaning files;</p>
            <img src="../../../../images/python-extensions/7.png" alt="">
            <p>
                Now go to "BApp Store" (another tab within the "Extensions" one).
            </p>
            <img src="../../../../images/python-extensions/8.png" alt="">
            <p>
                 Then clean your search bar, re-search the desired extension and you can see the button is now enabled and you can install your extension.
            </p>
